What is Notus?
**************

Notus is a notification platform for blockchains and blockchain DApps. We realized
Notus was necessary while building DApps for our clients at `delta.camp`_. You can
learn more about Notus at `notus.network`_.

    - Extensive `documentation`_
    - **DOWN THE ROAD**: Support various DLT chains other than Ethereum
    - .. **Tiny** (~88kb compressed; 284kb uncompressed)
